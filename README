#Photography Portfolio Website

A personal photography portfolio built with HTML5 and CSS3, showcasing favorite photos, team members, and a contact form.

## Features

- Dark modern design with gold highlights.
- Responsive photo gallery with hover effects.
- Team section with styled profile cards.
- Project design section showing the wireframe/mockup.
- Contact form 

Fully semantic HTML — uses <section>, <figure>, <fieldset>, <legend> instead of unnecessary <div>/<span>.

🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/photography-portfolio.git
cd photography-portfolio

2. Open the project

Simply open index.html in your favorite browser.
No build tools required.

📝 Contact Form Behavior

By default, the form uses:

<form class="contact-form" action="#" method="post">


which does not send data anywhere.

To make it functional, you can:

Add a JavaScript handler (onsubmit) to show a thank-you message.

Connect to a service like Formspree or Netlify Forms.

Hook up a backend with PHP, Node.js, or Python.

🎨 Customization

Replace images inside /images with your own.

Update names & bios in the Meet the Team section.

Edit colors in style.css (main highlight: #ffcc00).

Modify the blockquote for your favorite photography quote.
