cd photography-portfolio

2. Open the project

## Contact Form Behavior

- By default, the form uses:
<form class="contact-form" action="#" method="post">---
which does not send data anywhere.

- To make it functional, you can:
1.Add a JavaScript handler (onsubmit) to show a thank-you message.
2.Connect to a service like Formspree or Netlify Forms.
3.Hook up a backend with PHP, Node.js, or Python.
