    <h2>About This Website</h2>
    <p>
      This website is a collection of my <strong>favorite photography works</strong>.  
      It is designed with the belief that photography is more than just images â€”  
      it is a way of telling stories, remembering little details,  
      and holding onto emotions <em>long after they fade</em>.

      It remembers the little things, long after you have forgotten everything."
